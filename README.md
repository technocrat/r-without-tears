# r-without-tears
## Notes for the perplexed amateur

R can seem, at times, like an elaborate hazing ritual. With great power, such as the ability to perform statistical analyses that you have never heard of, comes great responsibility. No, that's not necessarily understanding the tools being abused, but in finding, or cobbling together, the right tool, often to do things that a lobotomized monkey can do in other programs.

If you find yourself spending more time following leads on Stackoverflow or tryng to figure out the examples in the R documentation or looking for an R package that just might have a feature you need, welcome. Here you will find walkthroughs, commented code snippets and an assurance that you are not alone in being mystified.

Don't expect an introduction to R or an R tutorial. For that you are on your own. The intended audience is those who have used R for a while but keep running up against *just not seeming to get it.* Or, to be honest, this is so that I don't forget the small victories and clumsy defeats that I've suffered over the past several years.

At some point, I'll welcome contributions and pull requests. First, though, I need to figure out the overall organization of a document with no preconceived organization.
